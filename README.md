# About Tenzies
A simple dice game where you roll 10 dice and try to match all the numbers. You can hold the number on a dice by clicking on it.

This is one of the last projects from the [Scrimba react course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e). It does have videos on how to create the project, but I decided to do the project solo.

# How to run project
Install the dependencies and run the project
```
npm install
npm start
```
